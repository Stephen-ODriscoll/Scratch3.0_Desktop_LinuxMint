This is the method I used to install Scratch 3.0 Desktop on Linux Mint.
Similar information is available on other github repositories but this a simplified one-time install specific to Mint. This method should also work on Ubuntu.

For debian users I recommend this repo: https://gist.github.com/lyshie/0c49393076b8b375ca1bd98c28f95fb0
There is a lot of information here and I learned a lot from it.

Run "ScratchSetUp" to start the install.
Tested and working on a clean install of Linux Mint 19.1.
Sometimes an error occurs which requires manual install of dependencies. If this happens a command will be suggested. Run this command and re-run the script after.
